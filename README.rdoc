== Development Notes
Built using:
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Sequel

=== Installation / Running
Install dependencies using Bundler:
    bundle install

Run using rackup file, for example:
    rackup config.ru

=== Issues / Roadmap

Use GitHub issues[http://github.com/bnadlerjr/leaflet/issues] for reporting bug
and feature requests.

=== Patches / Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull).
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
